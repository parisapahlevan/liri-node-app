# liri-node-app
In this application, we will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


1. Make an API call to "Bands in Town" and find your favorite bands perfomances: 
Template: node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>
Example: node liri.js concert-this scorpions


2. Make an API call to "Spotify" and look for your favorite songs. You will find 20 different version of of your favorite songs:
Template: node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>' 
Example: node liri.js spotify-this-song "bohemian rhapsody"


3. Make an API call to "OMDB" and find your favorite movie's information:
Template: node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
Example: liri.js dumbo

If the user doesn't type a movie in (node liri.js movie-this), the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'
